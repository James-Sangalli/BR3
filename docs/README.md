# BR3
BitReturn 3.0, this version of BitReturn is different to the other 2 versions. It is entirely automated (except for manually adding charities etc) and scans the blockchain paying out tax rebates directly without the need for individual application. It's codebase is mostly rewritten and it makes the other two versions unnecessary and obsolete. It also includes full documentation for the server.
